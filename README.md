# some-configurations
Hello :smile:.

This repository contains some basic files used by me in Sublime Text configuration when developing in Linux or Windows. They are intended to be the most common configuration used by you when you are starting to install your environment.
It provides shortcuts and preferences (only that by the moment).

In order to use these files in your Sublime Text installation, place them all at the folder "~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User" and then open Sublime Text. It might request to restart the app a couple of times while installing the packages.


#### The Keymap file:
This file contains some shortcuts for swap lines, duplicate lines, indent code and more.

#### The Preferences file:
This file contains the basic preferences such as translating tabs to 4 spaces, the most common settings used by me in my projects.

#### The Package Control file
This file contains the basic packages that I have installed on sublime for make the life easier when developing. These packages are for an improved sidebar, showing the color when there are rgb or hexadecimal formats, Better coffeescript and so on.
First at all, you have to install the Package Manager in SublimeText.
