# some-configurations
Hello :smile:.

This repository contains some basic files used by me in Sublime Text configuration when developing in Linux or Windows. They are intended to be the most common configuration used by you when you are starting to install your environment.
It provides shortcuts and preferences (onlye that by the moment).

#### The Keymap file:
This file contains some shortcuts for swap lines, duplicate lines, indent code and more.

### The preferences file:
This file contains the basic preferences such as translating tabs to 4 spaces, the most common settings used by me in my projects.
